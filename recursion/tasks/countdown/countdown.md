# Countdown to Zero (Recursion)

## Objective

Write a recursive function called `countdown(n)` that prints numbers starting from a given positive integer `n` down to 0.

## 📚 Recursion Basics

Recursion is when a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. Every recursive function needs:

1. **Base Case**: The simplest case where recursion stops
2. **Recursive Case**: The function calls itself with a modified input

## ✅ Requirements

1. 🚫 No loops allowed (`for` or `while`)
2. 🔄 Must use recursion (function calls itself)
3. 🔢 Print numbers from `n` down to 0 (each on new line)

## 📝 Example

**Function Call:**
```python
countdown(3)
```

**Expected output:**
