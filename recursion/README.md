# ðŸŒ€ Recursion Practice Project (Python)

## Learning Objectives

- Understand what recursion is and how it works in Python
- Learn where recursion is useful and where it's not
- Practice recursion with progressively challenging problems

## Tasks

> Complete each task by writing recursive solutions in the respective files inside `tasks/`.

1. **Countdown to Zero**
   - Create a function that prints countdown from `n` to `0` recursively.

2. **Factorial Function**
   - Write a function that calculates `n!` recursively.

3. **Compare Factorial Implementations**
   - Write both recursive and iterative factorials and compare their time using `timeit`.

4. **Traverse a Nested List**
   - Recursively visit each element in a nested list and print it.
   - Do the same **non-recursively** (using a stack or queue).

5. **Palindrome Checker**
   - Check if a string is a palindrome using recursion.

6. **Quicksort**
   - Implement quicksort recursively using pivot logic.
